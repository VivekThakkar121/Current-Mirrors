# CMOS Current Mirror Topologies

This project focuses on the design and performance evaluation of NMOS and PMOS current mirror topologies using Cadence Virtuoso and GPDK 180 nm CMOS technology.

## Implemented Topologies
- Simple Current Mirror  
- Cascode Current Mirror  
- High-Swing Cascode Current Mirror  

## Key Analyses
- Operating point and current accuracy  
- Output resistance and voltage swing  
- Comparison between theoretical and simulated results for both NMOS and PMOS configurations
